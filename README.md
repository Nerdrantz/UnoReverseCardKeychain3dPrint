# UnoReverseCardKeychain3dPrint
Uno reverse card keychain 3d print. 


This uno card keychain 3d print was originally made for a friend who wanted a gift for their SO but could not 
find what they wanted online. I am uploading these print designs for free, as is. I am also including the fusion 360
files for those who wish to modify the design.

Instructions for printing:

In order for this print to work properly, you want to print both faces seperately to have the smoothest top faces possible.
If you are printing this on a resin printer, then you may be able to combine the parts together and print them as one.

The top holes are for a keychain loop.

The middle holes are for helping connect the parts together. After sanding the back smooth, you can print a small
pin for both holes. Put the parts back to back with glue and put in the pins. You can seal them with glue, heat, or
in the case of my build, uv resin.

The parts are intended to be painted as the real cards, and then have the recessed spaces filled in with uv resin after
painting to seal everything. Some people may like having the 3d feel, and wish to not seal the spaces. Feel free to build 
how you would like. 

I'm releasing these files, as is, under MIT license. Enjoy!
